           <h2>So dead</h2>
           <h3>Aloe Vera</h3>
           <h5>More like Byebye Vera...</h5>
           <div>
               <p>I got a happy, healthy aloe from my bud Leslie who moved to SF like a start up cliche. Needless to say, it's super dead now.</p>
               <p>A brief list of my crimes:</p>
               <ol>
                   <li>Repotted healthy aloe into a bigger pot with <em>potting soil</em> instead of <em>cactus soil!!</em></li>
                   <li>Rerepotted with cactus soil but became convinced it was suffering root rot and unpotted once again, destroyed most of the roots, and then rererepotted</li>
                    <li> Became convinced that larger leaves were dead and that it would regrow its roots better with fewer leaves so I cut off all its big leaves</li>
                    <li>Finally, left it in an unbelievably afternoon hot sun windowsill</li>
               </ol>
               <p>Now it is yellow and shrivelled and definitely dead. Sorry Leslie!!</p>

           <h3>Boston Fern</h3>
           <h5>For whom this is named</h5>
           
           <div>
               <p>Another Leslie adoption, the fern was in questionable condition from the begining.</p>
               <p>A brief list of my crimes:</p>
                   <ol>
                   <li>Repotted into white plastic hanging container with no drainage holes</li>
                   <li>Panicked and rerepotted into plastic baby blue pot with drainage holes</li>
                   <li>Moved pot from room to room almost daily to try to see some kind of change</li>
               </ol>
               <p>Road to salvation:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Housed in bright indirect light in the bathroom</li>
                       <li>Watered twice a week with a few drops of <b>plant food</b> mmmmyum</li>
                       <li>Whispered sweet nothings</li>
                       <li>Provided physical and emotional space for growth</li>
                   </ul>
                <p>And honestly, I think BF is gonna make it!</p>

           <h3>Spider Plant</h3>
           <h5>My mom reminds me that spider plants are indestructable</h5>
           
           <div>
               <p>In May, my bud Sofia hosted a New Moon party so that we could drink some Kombucha and plant some clippings from her Spider Plant.</p>
               <p>This is the story of one such clipping:</p>
               <ol>
                   <li>Filled a small water glass halfway with pebbles and marbles, the other half with potting soil, and the lil guy nestled inside</li>
                   <li>Watered the darling whenever the soil was dry</li>
                   <li>Eventually repotted into an Ikea ceramic pot with potting soil and pebbles at the bottom for drainage</li>
                   <li>Looked at it lovingly and encouragingly</li>
               </ol>
               <p>Sometimes I pick its pot up and walk around saying "Look how happy it is!"</p>
